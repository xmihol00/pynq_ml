# Neural networks acceleration on a PYNQ Z2 board
So far this repository is mostly experimental containing many small apps with the aim of understanding HLS development and HW acceleration using the Pynq library on the PYNQ Z2 board. The goal is to a reasonable implement FPGA accelerated CNN for image recognition.
